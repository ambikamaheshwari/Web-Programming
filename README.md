This week, we’re going to take on Pig Latin
◦ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin
◦ If a word begins with a consonant, take all consonants
until the first vowel and place them at the end of the
word, and then add "ay" at the end.
◦ Trash -> Ashtray
◦ If a word begins with a vowel, add "yay" to the end.
◦ Artichoke => Artichokeyay
◦ Ignore other rules
http://php.net/manual/en/ref.strings.php
◦ Check out str_split and substr methods!
You may download assignment_2.php to start off.
Points will be taken off for invalid markup and PHP
errors.
Due Tuesday, September 21st, at 9am.
You must include at least one file,
LastName_FirstName_Assignment_2.php:
◦ Create a function, make_pig_latin, that takes a
string as input and returns a string in Pig Latin.
◦ Create an array containing the following strings:
◦ Banana
◦ Cranberry
◦ Pistachio
◦ Marshmallow
◦ Almond
◦ Mozzarella
◦ Gouda
◦ Avocado
◦ Iterate through the array and print a table that has
the index of the element in the first column, the
original word in the second column, and the Pig
Latin translation in the third column.
